# Fraud-Detection-Model

## 📌 Overview
This project applies machine learning techniques to detect fraudulent transactions.  
It combines **supervised learning** (Logistic Regression / XGBoost) with **unsupervised anomaly detection** (Isolation Forest) to flag suspicious activity.  
The model is deployed using **Streamlit**, providing an interactive web interface for predictions.

## 🚀 Features
- Preprocessing pipeline for transaction data (encoding, scaling, feature engineering).
- Supervised fraud detection model trained on labeled data.
- Isolation Forest anomaly detector for unseen fraud patterns.
- Streamlit app for user‑friendly predictions.
- Modular design for easy extension and deployment.
